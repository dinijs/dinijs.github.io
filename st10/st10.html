  <section>
    <p>Usually, in real estate marketplaces the properties are listed with multiple photos and some information regarding the property size, age and available facilities. The potential problem is that even if there is a property plan included in the listing, there is no way to actually know where each photo fit in the context of the property. This is why I have created a solution where every picture in a slideshow is referenced to a specific area in a house plan. Just by clicking somewhere in the house plan, the picture in the slideshow changes to one that has been assigned to the specific area. The slideshow can also be viewed without interacting with the house plan simply by clicking left and right arrows. To enhance the experience even further, users can select a specific floor, and this choice will update both the slideshow and the house plan.</p>
